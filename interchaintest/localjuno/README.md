# Goal

- An Easy configurable environment for running a local Juno node(s).
- Give the ability to easily IBC with a boolean flag
- Allow users to have multiple configs & switch between them depending on their testing needs.
- Look into <https://framework.embarklabs.io/> & local-osmosis / local-terra
- Use the sidecar branch from Justin and attach an explorer
